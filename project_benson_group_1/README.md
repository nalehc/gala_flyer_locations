* Clean data for New Jersey stations
* Format the data and only leave applicable columns
* Analyse and handle outliers
* Plot the data to understand the trends in the data
* Return a list of top stations sorted descending by number of exits
* Generate MTA score associated with each identified subway station

### Tech Companies
* **Associated Files:** tech_proximity_score_joyce.ipynb 
* Utilized web-scraping to generate list of 21 most valuable tech companies' in New York
* Utilized Google Maps API to get geo-locations of the identified tech companies
