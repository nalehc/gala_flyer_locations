## Project Benson
### MTA data
* **Associated Files:** MTA_Exploration_auste.ipynb and Clean_and_Process.ipynb
* Put the data into pandas data frame
* Explore the data through different angles (duplicates, exits distribution, etc.)
* Clean data for New Jersey stations
* Format the data and only leave applicable columns
* Analyse and handle outliers
* Plot the data to understand the trends in the data
* Return a list of top stations sorted descending by number of exits
* Generate MTA score associated with each identified subway station

### Tech Companies
* **Associated Files:** tech_proximity_score_joyce.ipynb 
* Utilized web-scraping to generate list of 21 most valuable tech companies' in New York
* Utilized Google Maps API to get geo-locations of the identified tech companies
* Tech company proximity score associated with each identified subway station (scoring code is actually in Alan's notebook)

### Starbucks
* **Associated Files:** Starbucks_and_Census_Alan.ipynb
* Utilized Google Maps API to find the geo-locations of the Starbucks surrounding each identified subway station
* Generated Starbucks score associated with each identified subway station

### Census Data
* **Associated Files:** Starbucks_and_Census_Alan.ipynb, community_districts.geojson, totpop_singage_sex2010_cd.xlsx
* Incorporated US Census 2010 data and geospatial data for the NYC Community Districts (CDs) to assign a gender score to each CD
* Generated gender score based on which CD each identified subway station was located in

### Visualize the MTA data and data from other sources on a map
* **Associated Files:**
* Use geopandas
* Colour code the stations based on different criteria  

### Summarize & Present
* **Associated Files:** project_benson_presentation.pdf 
* Draw conclusions
* Write up recommendation(s)
* Build a presentation (6 min)
* Divide up the presentation topics between team members
